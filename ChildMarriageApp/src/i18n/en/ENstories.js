      "When you are married you cannot go to school, and I only wanted to go to school. " +
      "My parents used to suffer to care for us to eat, so there came a time when they said I should leave school because they don't have anything to look after me. " +
      "\n\nThe man I was supposed to marry, he had a wife, he was already married. He had 5 children, some were older than me. When I went there I was small but the children were bigger than me. " +
      "I was just crying, I was just thinking that my life has ended, so I just realised that I had to run from them, that if I didnt run they would spoil my life. " +
      "\n\nAfter several attempts by Gloria's family to marry her off, local authorities intervened, mediating with her family and getting her back in school. " +
      "\n\nI wouldn't worry about my parents all day, I wouldn't say they were wrong with what they did, because of the poverty and the ignorance too they were unable to look after me. So I just said, \"God should forgive them\". " +
      "\n\nAll my brothers and sisters got married, so I'm the only, i'm the last-born who is going to school. My agemates, some are married, I'm even surprised, and you would be sorry to see them. " +
      "\n\nIt is not good to marry at this young age, when girls are very young and they are to give birth, they always suffer, because they are not at their age. " +
      "\n\nI just want to go to my school, that's the basic thing I want in my life. I want to be a midwife, so I can help pregnant women to deliver their children successfully. When I'm older I will marry, I would like to marry and give birth and also form a family.",
