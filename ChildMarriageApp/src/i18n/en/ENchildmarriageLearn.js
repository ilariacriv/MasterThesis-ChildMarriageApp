    q: "What is child marriage?",
    r: "Child marriage is a marriage or union in which one or both spouses are under 18 years old.",
  },
  q2: {
    q: "How common is child marriage?",
    r: "Child marriage is actually very common. More than 650 million women and girls alive today were married before their 18th birthday. Nineteen per cent of women between the ages of 20 and 24 around the world were child brides. \n There is good news: global child marriage rates are slowly falling. Around 2000, one in three women between the ages of 20 and 24 reported they had been married as children. In 2021, this number was just under one in five.",

  q3: {
    q: "What are the consequences of child marriage?",
    r:
      "Child brides are more likely to become pregnant before their bodies are mature, increasing the risks of both mother and child death and health issues. When an adolescent girl give birth in developing countries, where access to sexual and reproductive health services is generally low, complications from pregnancy and childbirth can be deadly. In fact, globally, these complications are the leading cause of death among adolescent girls." +
      "\n\nChildren who are married off are also vulnerable to sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Contributing to this problem is the fact that girls who have dropped out of school are more vulnerable to child marriage and less likely to be equipped with information about protecting themselves from sexual diseases and unplanned pregnancy." +
      "\n\nChild brides are particularly vulnerable to violence and abuse from their partners. They are less able to advocate for themselves and less able to escape abusive relationships. Mental illness is common among child brides, for example, due to their experience of violence. Girls who marry young are also more likely to think that wife beating is justified than women who marry later in life. " +
      "Married girls rarely enrol in school because they are expected to assume significant domestic responsibilities. This limits their future potential as it is more difficult to get a job when you are not educated and makes it harder for their families to escape poverty." +
      "\n\nLack of education and empowerment also mean girls are less able to advocate for the well-being of their own children. The children of child brides have higher mortality rates, worse nutritional outcomes and tend to be less educated." +
      "\nGirls in informal unions living with their partners experience many of the same consequences.",

  q4: {
    q: "What to do if you are pressured to get married",
    r: "It is your right to decide when and who to marry. You should try to say clearly that you donâ€™t want to marry in this moment, if it is not what you desire, and tell them that it is illegal to get married under 18. \nYou can look for support from organisations that can help you and keep you safe from those who are forcing you or ask to some adult you trust to help you to speak with those who are pressuring you. ",
  },
  q5: {
    q: "What to do if you are already married",
    r:
      "You have the same rights as every other girl." +
      "\nIf you are experiencing violence, you can contact an organisation that can help you in fighting this and tell some adult you trust about your situation so he or she can help you. " +
      "\nYou have the right to decide if you want a child and to get information about birth control. It is very important for you to get information as a early pregnancy can put you and your child at risk. " +
      "Finally, if you are not going to school and you would like to start again, it is your right to do it!",
